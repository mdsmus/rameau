Multi-measure rests do not collide with barlines and clefs.  They
are not expanded when you set @code{Score.skipBars}.  Although the
multi-measure-rest is a Spanner, minimum distances are set to keep it
colliding from barlines. 

Rests over measures during longer than 2 wholes use breve rests. When
more than 10 or more measures (tunable through @code{expand-limit})
are used then a different symbol is used.
