	  " Hara-kiri staves kill themselves if they are empty.  This
example really contains three staves, but as they progress, empty ones
are removed: this example has three staves, but some of them
disappear: note how the 2nd line only has the bar number 2. (That the
bar number is printed might be considered a bug, however, the scenario
of all staves disappearing does not happen in practice.)

Any staff brackets and braces are removed, both in the single staff
and no staff case.

This example was done with a pianostaff, which has fixed distance
alignment; this should not confuse the mechanism.
