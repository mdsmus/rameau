You need UFFI, ASDF, libSDL.  OpenGL is required for the OpenGL portions.

Run ``make'' to compile the C stub libraries.  It attempts a little
auto-detection of platform, but right now it's rudimentary.

In your Lisp:

Several ASDF systems have been defined:
  sdl, opengl, sdl-ttf, sdl-mix, sdl-img, sdl-examples, sdl-demos, etc

You can load them like so:
  (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'sdl-demos)  ; for example

The following examples should work, unless otherwise noted:

;; SDL examples:
(2dt:start) 

;; SDL (and OpenGL) demos:
(sdl-test:start)
(nehe:run-tutorial <x>)

;; Where <x> could be: 2-11, 16, :torus, :solar-system, :vertex-array


Has been tested on 
* CMUCL/Linux/x86
* Allegro/Linux/x86
* SBCL/Linux/x86
  - Tends to crash on the NeHe demos, not sure why.
* Allegro/Win32
* Lispworks/Linux/x86
  - Only the SDL portion seems to work correctly.  OpenGL demos range
    from no display to erratic.
* Lispworks/Win32
  - Won't resolve OpenGL symbols for some reason.
* OpenMCL/Darwin/PPC
  - Compiles, loads, crashes.  Argh.  Let me know if you can get this
    actually running, please!

Search paths:

If the default search paths and various other path-finding mechanisms
can't handle your setup, the relevant places to look are in ffi/uffi.lisp,
at variables *library-paths*, *library-types*, and *drive-letters*
and in examples/data.lisp variable *data-search-dirs*.
