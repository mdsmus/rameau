;;; Minimum binomial heaps
;;; 
;;; * a minimum binomial heap is a list of minimum binomial trees
;;;  sorted by size
;;; * a minimum binomial trees is a binomial tree that satisfies the heap property whereby
;;;  each node is smaller than or equal to each of its children according to the order predicate
;;;  i.e. 1 is the smallest positive integer for <
;;; * a binomial tree of rank n has a node with n children of ranks 0 to n-1 sorted by size,
;;;  with a total number of nodes 2**n
