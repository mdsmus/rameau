This is a start at an ASDF-INSTALL extension to upgrade installed
packages. Rather than attempt to parse and compare versions, it works
by comparing timestamps of a package's installed version against the
latest available tarball.

Currently, there is no reliable installation time timestamp to use for
comparison---a patch to ASDF-INSTALL is forthcoming. Until then, this
won't really work reliably.

There is a darcs repository at:

   http://slacknet.com/~jamesjb/asdf-upgrade

Or you can install ASDF-UPGRADE with ASDF-INSTALL:

   (asdf-install:install "asdf-upgrade")

Exported functions:

   ASDF-UPGRADE:REPORT

   Prints a report of installed packages and whether an upgrade is
   available (or the package is broken).

   ASDF-UPGRADE:UPGRADE

   Display a summary of upgradable packages and upgrade them using
   ASDF-INSTALL.
