### What it is

Class-mixins are a great idea but sometimes they lead to a proliferation of subclasses with names like `printable-touchable-composing-colored-shape-square-mixin` and that's just ugly. Common-Lisp is a dynamic-programming language; Dynamic-Classes brings dynamism to class definition!

You define the mixins and associate them with parameters. Then you 

As an example, here is some code from [cl-containers][] iterators that hooks parameters to iterator mixins:

    (add-parameter->dynamic-class
     :iterator :transform 'transforming-iterator-mixin)

    (add-parameter->dynamic-class
     :iterator :filter 'filtered-iterator-mixin)

    (add-parameter->dynamic-class
     :iterator :unique 'unique-value-iterator-mixin)

    (add-parameter->dynamic-class
     :iterator :circular 'circular-iterator-mixin)

and here it is in action:

    > (let ((i (make-iterator '(1 2 3))))
    	    (loop repeat 5 when (move-forward-p i) do
    		 (print (next-element i))))
    1 
    2 
    3 
    nil 
    
    > (let ((i (make-iterator '(1 2 3) :circular t)))
    	    (loop repeat 5 when (move-forward-p i) do
    		 (print (next-element i))))
    1 
    2 
    3 
    1 
    2 

    > (let ((i (make-iterator '(1 2 3) :circular t :transform #'sqrt)))
    	    (loop repeat 5 when (move-forward-p i) do
    		 (print (next-element i))))

    1.7320508

    1.4142135 

The `make-iterator` function calls `determine-iterator-class` to handle the work of figuring how (and possibly creating) the right class given the parameters.

    (defmethod make-iterator
        (iteratee &rest args &key (iterator-class nil) &allow-other-keys)
      (apply #'make-instance 
    	 (apply #'determine-iterator-class iteratee iterator-class args)
             :container iteratee
             args))

Dynamic-Classes can make prototyping a breeze (and it's lots of fun too)!

### Mailing Lists

  * [dynamic-classes-devel][devel-list]: A list for announcements, questions, patches, bug reports, and so on; It's for everything _but_ the sinking kitchen.

{anchor downloads}

### Where is it

A [darcs][] repository is available. The commands are listed below:

    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/dynamic-classes/

Dynamic-Classes is also [ASDF installable][]. Its CLiki home is right [where][cliki-home] you'd expect.

There's also a handy [gzipped tar file][tarball].

### What is happening

2008-May-26 - We've split off from metatilities and are living large and on our own! More tests and documentation coming ... soon (we hope).
