Please read the tutorial to get started.  To compile the tutorial from
source, you will need a reasonably complete LaTeX installation with
dvipdfm.

The project webpage is at http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-cairo2,
where you will find the repository, mailing lists, contact information
etc.

IMPORTANT: as of May 15, 2009, I have removed the global variable
*context*, and made context the first argument of every function.
There are several important reasons for this:

- it conforms better to the underlying Cairo bindings

- it is more Lispy

- having a global variable for the default context didn't make much
  sense in retrospect

Now the context argument comes FIRST.

I apologize if this inconvenienced anyone, but I had to do it
sometime, better now than later.  Tamas
