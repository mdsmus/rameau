from doctest (documentation)[http://docs.python.org/lib/doctest-finding-examples.html]

> Any expected output must immediately follow the final '>>> ' or '... ' line containing the code, and the expected output (if any) extends to the next '>>> ' or all-whitespace line.

(there are lots of other good ideas in this document).
