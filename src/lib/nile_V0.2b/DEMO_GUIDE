How to run the simulations
==========================

* cd to the main directory of the nile distribution

  and invoke any of the following

* ./run_batali_sim_cmucl

  starts a replicative run of Batalis simulation
  (output are statistics of every round and every
   5005 rounds a population dump)

* ./run_demo-par5

  Shows the basic ANN training functionality of the package on the
  example of the five bit parity problem. A 5-5-1 sigmoid network is 
  trained to correctly predict the parity of five bits. Training and
  test set are complete. Updates are done using conjugate gradients
  (can be changed in the shell-script, substituting ':method :cg' by
  ':method :sd' for steepest descent updates, for more options see
  code/nile_demos.lisp)

  The sum of squares errors while training are shown, followed by
  a dump of the network which was trained.

./run_generational_sim_cmucl

  Runs a generational variation of the Batali simulation and outputs
  statistics as well as population dumps every 4 generations.

  BEWARE: A generation to be trained takes much longer than a round in
  the standard Batali simulation, so the first line of output may take
  a long time to appear.

./run_learnability

  Runs a batch of learnability experiments and outputs statistics.
