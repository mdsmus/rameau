	NILE V0.2b (pre-) release
	=========================

This is the NILE package, including COMMON LISP code for neural
network simulations and some simple simulations of the evolution of
language.

Unfortunately the documentation for this package as well as the parts
of the code are still in a somehow messy state, nevertheless I wanted
to release it in order to allow others to make use of this work as
soon as possible.

Please refer to the files INSTALL_GUIDE, DEMO_GUIDE and USER_GUIDE for
some hints on how to use the software.
