;; src/algoritmos/knn.lisp
;; A k-nearest-neighbor chord finder, for use in Rameau.

;; The training examples as stored in an alist, keyed by their
;; pitches. In the e-knn version, only one sonority is stored at a
;; time, while in the ec-knn a few surrouding sonorities are also
;; stored.

;; The values in the alist are also alists. These lists are keyed by
;; the classes for that example (there can be more than one) and the
;; values are the counts for how many times each class appears.
