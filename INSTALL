Dependencies
============

To build rameau you'll have to install a few number of lisp libraries.
If you are a lisp developer you'll probably want to install all
libraries under the "lisp" section at
http://git.genos.mus.br/cgit.cgi. If you want to compile rameau the
easiest way, just issue the commands:

    make LOCALDEPS=t update-deps rameau

This command will download all necessary libraries and compile rameau.
Every time you want to compile rameau you should issue this command.
After the first time it will just update the libraries, without
downloading the full thing again (that is, it will be faster)

To compile rameau you'll need also to install the following programs:

    cairo2

To use rameau you'll need to install the following programs:

    cairo2 lilypond
