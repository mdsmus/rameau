The ideal length of a hyphen is determined by its @code{length}
property, but it may be shortened down to @code{minimum-length} in
tight situations. If in this it still does not fit, the hyphen will be
omitted.

Like all overrides within @code{\lyricsto} and @code{\addlyrics}, the
effect of a setting is delayed is one syllable."
