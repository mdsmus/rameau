\header{ texidoc = "@cindex Tabulature
A sample tablature, with both normal staff and tab.

Tablature is done by overriding the note-head formatting function, and
putting it on a 6-line staff. A special engraver takes care of going
from string-number + pitch to number.

String numbers can be entered as note articulations (inside a chord) and
chord articulations (outside a chord)
