\header { texidoc=" You can write stencil callbacks in Scheme, thus
providing custom glyphs for notation elements.  A simple example is
adding parentheses to existing stencil callbacks.

The parenthesized beam is less successful due to implementation of the
Beam. The note head is also rather naive, since the extent of the
parens are also not seen by accidentals.
